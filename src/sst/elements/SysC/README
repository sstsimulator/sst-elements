The patch must be applied to your systemc installation
The patch mearly exposes a member variable for public use.
The location of the SystemC library must be in LD_RUN_PATH.

The primary bit used to intrgrate SystemC codes is the TLMSimpleMem module.
It takes care of all the translation to allow SystemC to be used via the
SST::Inerfaces::SimpleMem interface. Simply create a component that contains
a SimpleMem pointer, load TLMSimpleMem as a module, use getSocket() to retrieve
the initiator socket and bind the target socket of your SystemC object to it.

To provide a simplemem interface to the wrapper, simply implement your component
as a module instead and forward all necessary calls to the instanced interface;

All SystemC object need a Controller. Please create this as your first component
in your SDL file.
