/*
 * This module implements the system call portion of the SimpleScalar
 * instruction set architecture.  The system call definitions are borrowed
 * from Ultrix.  All system calls are executed by the simulator (the host) on
 * behalf of the simulated program (the target). The basic procedure for
 * implementing a system call is as follows:
 *
 *	1) decode the system call (this is the enum in "syscode")
 *	2) copy system call inputs in target (simulated program) memory
 *	   to host memory (simulator memory), note: the location and
 *	   amount of memory to copy is system call specific
 *	3) the simulator performs the system call on behalf of the target prog
 *	4) copy system call results in host memory to target memory
 *	5) set result register to indicate the error status of the system call
 *
 * That's it...  If you encounter an unimplemented system call and would like
 * to add support for it, first locate the syscode and arguments for the system
 * call when it occurs (do this in the debugger) and then implement a proxy
 * procedure in syscall.c.
