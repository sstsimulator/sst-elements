Configure and build OpenMPI

SST=$HOME/test/SST

../configure \
--prefix=`pwd`/install \
--with-platform=../contrib/platform/snl/portals4-m5 \
--with-portals4=$SST/sst/elements/M5/app/lib \
LIBS="-lm5rt -lptlNic -lstdc++" \
LDFLAGS="-L$SST/sst/elements/M5/app/lib/lib" \
CPPFLAGS="-I$SST/sst/elements/M5/app/lib/include"

Notes

The portals stack is split between libportals.a and libptlNic.a.
libportals.a is basically a wrapper that initializes a network interface and 
redirects portals calls to the NIC library. 

libptlNic.a is written in c++ hence the -lstc++. 

libm5rt.a provides cnos_* functions.

If mpi built correctly you should now be able to compile an mpi app.

mpicc -static main.c -u ptlNic

Note that libptlNic.a has a constructor that registers the NIC.
However libptlNic.a is not referenced by any other code hence the -u ptlNic. 
This forces linking of libptlNic.a

Executing an mpi application is the same as an portals application, 
see README-portals.
