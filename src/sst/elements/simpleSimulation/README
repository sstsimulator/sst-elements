README for simpleSimulation
-------------------------------

The simpleSimulation provides real-world examples of various simulators that can be used as learning tools or resources:

- simpleCarWash  : A simulation modeling the queuing of cars through a carwash. The entire simulation is modeled in a single
                   monolithic component.
- distCarWash    : A distributed model of the same simulation as simpleCarWash. It splits the car wash into two parts
                   (components): the car wash itself and customer generator. Because it has two components, the simulation can
                   be run in parallel.
