ChangeLog for libcprops
-----------------------

Version 0.1.8 15-Dec-2007

 o   fixed test_reindex.c and test_reindex_unique test programs
 o   fixed cp_multimap reindexing fiasco
 o   fixed cp_multimap item removal bug 

Version 0.1.7 30-Nov-2007

 o   added cp_multimap - a data structure based on cp_rbtree which allows
     creating multiple indices on tree content
 o 	 added call to SSL_library_init() for openssl 0.98e and missing error
 	 checking on context creation. Thanks to Johny Jugianto	for pointing this
 	 out.
 o   added cp_*_find functions to locate nearest keys using CP_OP_* 
     operators in cp_avltree, cp_rbtree, cp_splaytree and cp_sorted_hash
 o   fixed a bug reading headers with leading whitespace in httpclient.c 
 o   cp_client now performs DNS lookup using (gnu) gethostbyname_r if available
     - apart for being reentrant, this improves name resolution in some setups 
 o   added missing include directive in cpsp.c - thanks to Francois 
     Deppierraz and Martin Albrecht for pointing this out
 o   fixed memory leak in cp_mempool_destroy - thanks to Kyle Wheeler for 
     patch

Version 0.1.6 15-Sep-2006

 o   added cp_narytree, an in-memory btree implementation
 o   dropped ``inline'' keyword throughout the code
 o   added cp_sorted_hash, an ordered hash table implementation
 o   added cp_mempool, a fixed size memory pool
 o   added cp_shared_mempool, a shareable collection of mempools
 o   changed hash code and table sizes to unsigned long
 o   improved dependency checking in build process. In particular the build 
     will run if the makefile itself has been changed, e.g. after running 
     ./configure.
 o   changed HAVE_* defines in config.h to CP_HAS_* to allow inclusion
     in other autoconf'ed packages
 o   fixed build on netbsd
 o   fixed open bsd warnings

Version 0.1.5 1-Aug-2006

 o   win32 port
 o   added cp_heap, a heap implementation based on libheap, contributed to
     libcprops by Kyle Wheeler
 o   replaced recursive tree deletion functions with iterative versions
     in rb.c, avl.c and splay.c. Thanks to Kyle Wheeler for patch.
 o   cp_hashlist_iterator_remove was setting the iterator position to a
     pointer in the released entry - fixed
 o   cp_splaytree_insert fixed to increment item count. Thanks to Kyle
     Wheeler for this and the next bug fix.
 o   cp_hashlist_destroy_custom was ignoring the parameter destructor 
     functions - fixed


Version 0.1.4 15-Jun-2006

 o   improved request body reading in cp_httpsocket - POST body now handled 
     correctly
 o   in cgi service: POST data now written to CGI stdin
 o   HTTP_COOKIE CGI environment variable now correctly set
 o   fixed bug reading http response in cp_httpclient with 
     Transfer-Encoding: chunked
 o   fixed transaction handling in cp_trie_unlock
 o   including <sys/types.h> in client.h on FreeBSD, NetBSD
 o   if poll(2) is not available, select(2) is used instead and httpclient.h 
     defines cp_httpclient_ctl_default_get_fds and cp_httpclient_ctl_get_fds 
     rather than cp_httpclient_ctl_default_get_pollfds and
     cp_httpclient_ctl_get_pollfds. 
 o   if dlfcn.h not available, dbms dynamic linking disabled and db.o not 
     compiled unless dbms enabled explicitly or through --with-postgres or 
     --with-mysql options
 o   fixed build on Mac OS X

Version 0.1.3 30-May-2006

 o   added cp_string_filter() to delete all occurrences of a character from a
     string
 o   added utility function filter_string to delete all occurrences of a 
     character from a null terminated string
 o   changed allocation check order to prevent a possible SEGV on allocation
     failure in cp_pooled_thread_create() - thanks to smartyxt for reporting
     this
 o   changed cp_vector_destroy() and cp_vector_destroy_custom to check for
     NULL values
 o   fixed build in client.c and httpclient.c when ssl is disabled

Version 0.1.2 23-May-2006
-------------------------

 o   added cp_avltree - an AVL tree implementation
 o   changed cp_XXX_lock() and cp_XXX_unlock() function semantics to lock the
     collection while allowing the thread owning the lock to call collection
     insert, delete, search etc. functions without deadlocking. This allows
     writing transaction like code where the collection lock() and unlock()
     functions behave like a 'start transaction' and 'end transaction' - at
     least as far as synchronization is concerned, which is more intuitive and
     solves an issue that would otherwise require digging into the internals
     of the specific collection at use (ie, better ``encapsulation''). On the
     downside, code relying on the old behavior will have to be rewritten.
     Affected collections are cp_list, cp_priority_list, cp_hashtable, 
     cp_hashlist and cp_trie.
 o   added cp_list_get_mode(), cp_list_set_mode() and cp_list_unset_mode() 
     functions
 o   added cp_priority_list_get_mode(), cp_priority_list_set_mode() and 
     cp_priority_list_unset_mode() functions
 o   changed the return value of cp_hashtable_set_mode,
     cp_hashtable_unset_mode, cp_hashtable_set_min_size, 
     cp_hashtable_set_min_fill_factor, cp_hashtable_set_max_fill_factor 
     and cp_hashtable_remove_all from void to int to report locking failure
 o   changed the return value of cp_hashlist_set_mode,
     cp_hashlist_unset_mode, cp_hashlist_set_min_size, 
     cp_hashlist_set_min_fill_factor, cp_hashlist_set_max_fill_factor and
     cp_hashlist_callback from void to int to report locking failure
 o   added functions cp_trie_get_mode, cp_trie_set_mode, cp_trie_unset_mode
 o   cleanup - removed some old #if 0 sections
 o   added a Makefile for the examples directory
 o   fixed memory leak in cp_hashtable_contains
 o   fixed memory leak in cp_list_iterator_remove
 o   fixed bad address in cp_list_iterator_prev after iterator is moved beyond
     the end of the list
 o   fixed SEGV when attempting cp_dbms_load_driver() without having loaded 
     any drivers
 o   fixed an invalid memory access when performing redirects in cp_httpclient
 o   fixed compiler warnings, memory leaks in example programs

     cp_hash_compare_addr() in hashtable.c
 o   cp_string_create(char *ptr, int len) checks for negative len values
 o   added function cp_thread_pool_wait() to block until pool is idle

     SSL_CTX
