# These commands build and run part of the RISCV test suite. It does not run 32BiT and RVV instructions.
#
# NOTE: The test suite would normally run natively on a RISCV system and each test would run in a virtual machine.
# The test suite is modifed such that each test executable runs directly in Vanadis and run-riscv-tests checks
# the output of Vanadis to see if the test succeeded.

# Note that not all tests pass. "run-riscv-tests.out" shows which test pass.
