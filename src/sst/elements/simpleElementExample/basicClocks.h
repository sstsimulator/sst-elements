/*
 * Summary: This example demonstrates registering clocks and handlers.
 *
 * Concepts covered:
 *  - Clocks and clock handlers
 *  - TimeConverters
 *  - UnitAlgebra for error checking
 *
 * Description:
 *  The component registers three clocks with parameterizable frequencies. 
 *  The constructor uses UnitAlgebra to check that each frequency parameter includes units.
 *  Clock0 uses mainTick as its handler. Clock1 and Clock2 use otherTick as their handler 
 *  and pass an id (1 and 2, respectively) that identifies which clock is calling the shared handler.
 *
 * Simulation:
 *  The simulation runs until Clock0 has executed 'clockTicks' cycles. Clock0 prints a message to 
 *  STDOUT ten times during the simulation (see 'printInterval' variable). This notification prints
 *  Clock0's current cycle, the simulation time, and uses Clock1 and Clock2's TimeConverters to print
 *  the current time in terms of Clock1 and Clock2 cycles.
 *  Clock1 and Clock2 print a notification each time their handler is called. After ten ticks, Clock1 and
 *  Clock2 suspend themselves.
