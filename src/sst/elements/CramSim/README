CramSim - ControlleR And Memory SIMulator
Developed using the Structural Simulation Toolkit

PREREQUISITES TO INSTALLATION:
  - Boost 1.57
  - OpenMPI 1.8.8

INSTALLATION:
  - Once the repo is cloned, cd to main folder (sstcramsim/)
  - Run "./autogen.sh"
  - Run "cd sst/elements/CramSim"
  - Run "make"

  When editing the simulator:
  - If adding a new class:
    - Add class files to Makefile.am
    - cd to parent directory "sstcramsim"
    - Run "./autogen.sh"
    - Run "cd sst/elements/CramSim"
    - Run "make"
  - If modifying existing files:
    - Run "make"

RUNNING A SIMULATION:
  - Syntax:
    sst --lib-path:./libs/ PYTHON_TEST_FILE.py --model-options="--configfile=CONFIG.cfg --tracefile=TRACE.trc cfgOverrideKey=cfgOverrideVal"

  Python file instantiates SST components and links them together. It also provides the simulator with access to "parameter knobs". Many different test
  python files exist in ./tests/ . Here are some highlights.
  Command-line examples are found in the "tests/run.py" file.
    - test_txngen.py : Runs simulation using a series of randomly or sequentially generated instructions. "mode" flag are required in the --model-options
      - seq   : sst --lib-path=.libs test_txngen.py --model-options="--configfile=CONFIG.cfg mode=seq"
      - rand  : sst --lib-path=.libs test_txngen.py --model-options="--configfile=CONFIG.cfg mode=rand"

    - test_txntrace.py: Runs simulation with a commandline-provided trace file and config file. "traceFileType" flag are required in the --model-options
      - default (dramsim2 type) : sst --lib-path=.libs test_txntrace.py --model-options="--configfile=CONFIG.cfg traceFileType=DEFAULT traceFile=TRACE.trc"
      - usimm type              : sst --lib-path=.libs test_txntrace.py --model-options="--configfile=CONFIG.cfg traceFileType=USIMM traceFile=TRACE.trc"

    - Both test_txngen.py and test_txntrace.py allow overriding of config parameters in the --model-options. Simply add the config name and value (e.g. nBL=8).
      Detailed example : sst --lib-path=.libs/ tests/test_txngen.py --model-options="--configfile=ddr4.cfg mode=rand nBL=8 nWR=30 dumpConfig=1"
      The special override dumpConfig=1 will print all the global config params read from the config files and resulting from overrides to the output

    - Both test_txngen.py and test_txntrace.py also allow multiple config files to be specified in --model-options. Later config files take precedence whenever there is a config conflict.
      Example: sst --lib-path=.libs/ tests/test_txngen.py --model-options="--configfile=test_system.cfg --configfile=test_device.cfg nBL=8"
      
    - test_txntrace4.py : Similar to test_txntrace.py but is intended to be used as part of the Verimem test suite


VERIMEM:
  Verimem is a series of traces intended to be run to confirm the validity of the results of a simulator. Verimem's test traces that apply to the
  granularity of this simulator are 1, 4, 5, and 6. Suites 2, 3, and 7 require a model that includes bank rows and columns to provide any insights that
  1, 4, 5, and 6 don't already.

  NOTE: VeriMem tests will not run without downloading the traces. SST directory structure mandated that the VeriMem traces cannot be checked in into the sst-elements directory. 
  The VeriMem traces are currently (01 2017) available here: https://github.com/sstsimulator/sst-downloads/releases
  The filenames begin with sst-CramSim-trace_verimem in the SST Test Support Files section.
 
  To run Verimem (from within /sstcramsim/sst/elements/CramSim/):
      python ./tests/VeriMem/test_verimem1.py BOOL_DEBUG_OUTPUT
    BOOL_DEBUG_OUTPUT should be either 0 or 1, depending on if debugging output is wanted or not.
  This script runs simulations using a config file (to edit, change the variable "config_file") and a series of different trace files specifically structured to
  test the validity of the simulator's results.
  
SST BASICS:
  SST allows the usage of isolated components. Each component has its own internal clockCycle. Every cycle, each component runs its clockTic() method.
    The simulator is cycle-based in that in a given cycle, all the clockTics are to be seen as running concurrently.
  Components can be connected using SST-provided links. A link must be registered (and named) by the two components it connects. Once both components register the link,
    SST-provided Event objects can be sent on the link. The Event class can be subclassed to include specific event types that carry specific payloads (e.g. c_TxnReqEvent).
    The simulator is event-based in that components respond discretely to events as they arrive.

CramSim.cpp:
  This is the factory-pattern class that is used to instantiate SST components. Link names and parameters are explicitly defined here so that the python file
  can properly map them together.

MODEL OVERVIEW:
  Each SST component listed is connected to the component above it and below it

  - Txn Generator (multiple options):
    - c_TxnGen
      - Generates Txns in sequential/random-address order
    - c_TraceFileReader
      - Reads Txns from a trace file (dramsim2 or usimm trace format)

  - Controller : c_Controller
    - Receives Txn requests from TxnGen and stores them. Every cycle a txn is removed from the buffer, converted to Cmds, and sent to c_DIMM
    - Receives Cmd responses from c_DIMM and updates the Txn that Cmd "belonged" to. Every cycle a completed txn is removed from the response buffer and returned to TxnGen
    - Subcomponents
      1) c_AddressHasher : address mapper that map the physical address to the device address (e.g., channel, rank, bank, and column index)
      2) c_TxnScheduler :  transaction scheduler that reorder the transactions
      3) c_TxnConverter :  transaction converter that converts read and write trasacntions to memory-specific commands (e.g., READ -> ACT/READ/PRECHARGE) 
      4) c_CmdScheduler :  command scheduler that selects a command queue and picks memory commands from the command queue
      5) c_DeviceDriver :  device driver that maintains status of memory devices and send commands to the memory devices 

  - Memory : c_DIMM
    - Receives a Cmd request from Controller and maps it to its particular bank before sending it to that bank.
    - Receives a Cmd response from its internal banks and sends it back to Controller


  ADDITIONAL INFO:
    - Bank addresses are mapped from the singleton class c_AddressHasher.
      - The address hash is highly flexible, and can be specified at the bit granularity. The map string is interpreted as little-endian (MSB first).
      - Checking is done to verify that the structure-level parameters (e.g. numRanksPerChannel) match with the number of bits defined in the address map
      - A simple map is also available. If only one instance of each type is defined the map will be automatically expanded to cover the structure sizes defined by the normal parameters.
      - If the complex address map type is defined and fewer map bits are defined than those defined by the structure parameters (e.g. map contains R:2 and numRanksPerChannel is 8) a warning will be printed but simulation will continue with only a subset of the structures being used (some ranks can never be accessed).
      - If the complex addres map type is defined and more map bits are defined than those defined by the structure parameters (e.g. map contains R:2 and numRanksPerChannel is 1) then the simulation will abort.
      - The underscore '_' can be used as spacers to increase readability of address maps
      - Address map key:
      	C - Channel
        c - PseudoChannel
	R - Rank
	B - BankGroup
	b - Bank
	r - Row
	l - Column
	h - Cacheline (matches burst size in bytes)
      - Examples:
      	_r_l_b_R_B_h_ - simple version, will be expanded as necessary to fill defined structures in the order defined. No 'C' included, so only 1 channel is possible.
	__r:15_l:7__bb__R__BB__h:6__ - 15 row bits at MSB, folled by 7 column bits, 2 bank bits, 1 Rank bit, 2 BankGroup bits, and 6 cacheline bits
	
    - It is highly recommended that simulator output is piped to an external file. There is usually a lot of output to decipher
