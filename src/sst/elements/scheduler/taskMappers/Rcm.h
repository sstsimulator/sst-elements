                 * Then @c rcmi() generates the reverse Cuthill-McKee ordering for
                 * this blocked, using @a p as the root.
                 *
                 * @param[in] n is the number of nodes/vertices in the graph.

                 *               points  to  the
                 *               start  of  the  adjacency  list for @a p.
                 *               @a xadj[<i>p</i>+1]-1 points to the last element in
                 *               the adjacency list for @a p.
                 *               If the graph has <i>n</i> nodes, then
                 *               @a xadj has to have <i>n</i>+1 entries.

                 *               An entry in @a xadj is the index of the first

                 *               set to @c -1.  The  @a mask  array  is  used  to

                 *               to indicate that the node @a p is not to be considered
