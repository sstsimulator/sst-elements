// This is the Level - Spread policy for dragonfly systems which spreads
// jobs within the smallest network level that a given job can fit in at the time
// of its allocation. If a job fits within the available nodes that are connected
// to a single router, it selects the router with the largest number of idle nodes
// and allocates the job there. If a job cannot fit within a single router but fits
// within the available nodes in a single group, it selects the most idle group
// and allocates the job there. To further reduce load imbalance on local links in
// this group, it selects nodes connected to different routers in a round - robin
// manner. If a job cannot fit within a single group, it spreads the job throughout
// the entire network, where it selects nodes in different groups in a round - robin
// manner.
