/*
 * This Component example demonstrates the use of SST's "lifecycle" functions.
 *
 * These components can be instantiated in a ring and each
 * component has a right and a left link. Components let each
 * other know how many events they want to receive and each component
 * sends each other the requested number of events. At the end of simulation,
 * components notify each other of this information and print it.
 * 
 * Simulation lifecycle
 * 1) Construction
 *      Components ensure both their links are connected
 *      Components read params
 * 2) Init
 *      Components discover the names of the other components in the ring
 * 3) Setup
 *      Components report the names of the components they discovered
 *      Components send an initial event to start the simulation. 
 *      This is required because this is a purely event-based simulation
 *      so an event is needed to start it.
 * 4) Run
 *      Components send and receive messages
 *      Components send events to the left
 *          - If a component receives an event for itself, it deletes the event and sends a new event if is has not sent enough events yet 
 *          - If a component receives an event for a different component, it forwards the event to the left
 *      Simulation ends when there are no events left in the system
 * 5) Complete
 *      Components tell their left neighbor goodbye and their right neighbor farewell
 * 6) Finish
 *      Components print who told them what during complete()
 * 7) Destruction
 *      Components clean up memory
 *
 *  If SST receives a SIGINT or SIGTERM, each component reports how many events are left to send before it terminates
 *  If SST receives a SIGUSR2, each component reports how many events are left to send and continues
 *
 * Concepts covered:
 *  - Use of init(), setup(), complete(), and finish()
 *  - Use of printStatus() and emergencyShutdown()
