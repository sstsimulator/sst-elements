/**
A Receive Completion Queue.
Based on packets coming in, it determines when a message has completely arrived.
A large message, in some models, is broken up into many #message_chunk
objects.  When using minimal, in-order routing, tracking message completion is easier
because a packet can be marked as the "tail" and used to track when an entire message has arrived.
When using adaptive or multipath routing, messages arrive out-of-order.
This class tracks whether all packets have been received and signals to some handler
that an entire message has fully arrived.
