 * x86.def - X86 ISA machine definition
 * This file has been substantially rewritten from the pre-release maintained by
 * Brad Calder et al.  In particular, uop definitions have been implemented such
 * that all supported x86 macro-instructions can be decomposed into uop flows.
 * The uop definitions have also been modified to limit each uop to only three
 * inputs and one output.  Additional uop definitions have been provided to help
 * decompose complex x86 macro-instructions to satisfy the 3-in/1-out constraint.

/* FIXME: these comments are out-of-date */

/* This file defines all aspects of the SimpleScalar instruction set
 * architecture.  Each instruction set in the architecture has a DEFINST()
 * macro call included below.  The contents of a instruction definition are
 * as follows:
 *
 *   DEFINST(<enum>,      <opcode>,
 *       <opname>,      <operands>,
 *       <fu_req>,      <iflags>,
 *       <output deps...>,    <input deps...>,
 *       <expr>)
 *
 * Where:
 *
 *   <enum>  - is an enumerator that is returned when an instruction is
 *      decoded by SS_OP_ENUM()
 *   <opcode>  - is the opcode of this instruction
 *   <opname>   - name of this instruction as a string, used by disassembler
 *   <operands>  - specified the instruction operand fields and their printed
 *       order for disassembly, used by disassembler, the recognized
 *      operand field are (the instruction format is detailed in
 *      the header file ss.h):
 *        J - target field
 *        j - PC relative target (offset + PC)
 *        s - S register field
 *        b - S register field (base register)
 *        t - T register field
 *        d - D register field
 *        S - S register field (FP register)
 *        T - T register field (FP register)
 *        D - D register field (FP register)
 *        o - load address offset (offset)
 *        i - signed immediate field value
 *        u - unsigned immediate field value
 *        U - upper immediate field value
 *        H - shift amount immediate field value
 *        B - break code
 *
 *   <fu_req>  - functional unit requirements for this instruction
 *   <iflags>  - instruction flags, accessible via the SS_OP_FLAGS()
 *      macro, flags are defined with F* prefix in ss.h
 *   <output deps...>
 *    - a list of up to two output dependency designators, the
 *      following designators are recognized (place an DNA in any
 *      unused fields:
 *        DGPR(N)   - general purpose register N
 *        DGPR_D(N) - double word general purpose register N
 *        DCGPR(N)  - general purpose register conditional on
 *              pre/post- increment/decrement mode
 *        DFPR_L(N) - floating-point register N, as word
 *        DFPR_F(N) - floating-point reg N, as single-prec float
 *        DFPR_D(N) - floating-point reg N, as double-prec double
 *        DHI        - HI result register
 *        DLO        - LO result register
 *        DFCC      - floating point condition codes
 *        DCPC      - current PC
 *        DNPC      - next PC
 *        DNA        - no dependence
 *
 *   <input deps...>
 *    - a list of up to three input dependency designators, the
 *      designators are defined above (place an DNA in any unused
 *      fields.
 *
 *   <expr>  - a C expression that implements the instruction being
 *       defined, the expression must modify all architected state
 *      affected by the instruction's execution, by default, the
 *      next PC (NPC) value defaults to the current PC (CPC) plus
 *      SS_INST_SIZE, as a result, only taken branches need to set
 *      NPC
 *
 *      The following predefined macros are available for use in
 *      DEFINST() instruction expressions to access the value of
 *      instruction operand/opcode field values:
 *
 *        RS      - RS register field value
 *        RT      - RT register field value

 *        SHAMT   - shift amount field value

 *
 *      To facilitate the construction of performance simulators
 *      (which may want to specialize their architected state
 *      storage format), all architected register and memory state
 *      is accessed through the following macros:
 *
 *        GPR(N)         - read general purpose register N
 *        SET_GPR(N,E)   - write general purpose register N with E
 *        GPR_D(N)       - read double word general purpose reg N
 *        SET_GPR_D(N,E) - write double word gen purpose reg N w/ E

 *        LO             - read LO result register
 *        SET_LO(E)      - write LO result register with E
 *        FCC             - read floating point condition codes
 *        SET_FCC(E)     - write floating point condition codes w/ E
 *        CPC             - read current PC register
 *        NPC             - read next PC register
 *        SET_NPC(E)     - write next PC register with E
 *        TPC             - read target PC register
 *        SET_TPC(E)     - write target PC register with E
 *

 *        WRITE_WORD(E,A)       - write word value E to address A
 *        WRITE_DWORD(E,A)       - write double word value E to address A
 *
 *      Finally, the following helper functions are available to
 *      assist in the construction of instruction expressions:
 *
 *        INC_DEC(E,N,S) - execute E and update N as per pre/post-
 *             incr/decr addressing sementics for an
 *             access of S bytes
 *        OVER(X,Y)      - check for overflow for X+Y, both signed

  /* WARNING: Be careful about the use of AGEN vs. STA in uop flows.
     AGEN is used to compute an address that will be stored in a
     register, whereas STA (and the BGEN equivalents) is used
     specifically in combination with a STD uop.  The choice
     affects store-queue allocation and execution port assignment.
     Like the Intel implementations, loads are single uops (i.e.
     they do not have separate AGEN uops associated with them as
     you may be used to from the old-skool SimpleScalar organization). */
