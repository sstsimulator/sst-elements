 * Class to implement allocation algorithms of the family that
 * includes Gen-Alg, MM, and MC1x1; from each candidate center,
 * consider the closest points, and return the set of closest points
 * that is best.  Members of the family are specified by giving the
 * way to find candidate centers, how to measure "closeness" of points
 * to these, and how to evaluate the sets of closest points.

 GenAlg - try centering at open places;
 select L_1 closest points;
 eval with sum of pairwise L1 distances
 MM - center on intersection of grid in each direction by open places;
 select L_1 closest points
 eval with sum of pairwise L1 distances
 MC1x1 - try centering at open places
 select L_inf closest points
 eval with L_inf distance from center
